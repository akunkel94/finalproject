You figured it out!! You worked your way through the maze picking up different items in your inventory and found the fuse to fix the elevator. 
You feel a quick jerk of the elevator and it begins to move upwards. 
The elevator doors open and you see that you have escaped the MAZE and the
darkness is finally left behind!
