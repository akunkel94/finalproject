You figured it out!! You worked your way through the maze picking up different items in your inventory and found the fuse to fix the elevator. 
You feel a quick jerk in the elevator, but now feel the motion of elevator
rising upward. 
The elevator doors open and you see you are no longer kept in the MAZE and the
darkness is left behind!
