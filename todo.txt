-create a map so we know which rooms lead to which rooms (this won't be used in the game (or it could be, your choice))

-decide on room names

-decide on objects for the rooms, where they'll be placed, and how they'll be used

-write any story pieces for the game including intro, outro and middle bits

-test to see if I can push this
