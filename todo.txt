-create a map so we know which rooms lead to which rooms (this won't be used in the game (or it could be, your choice))

-decide on room names

-decide on objects for the rooms, where they'll be placed, and how they'll be used

-write any story pieces for the game including intro, outro and middle bits

-test to see if I can push this


txt file format (each record will be a set number of lines so there will be no blank lines between records)
-if there is no info for a line use 0 to denote that it should be empty

So a record may look something like,

DYNAMITE STORAGE ROOM
This is the room that used to be used for storing dynamite.
FUSE
CHEST
DYNAMITE
ELEVATOR SHAFT
0
MINE FACE
PICKAXE
LAMP ROOM
0
0
0

This record would read:

You have entered the dynamite storage room. This is the room that used to be
used for storing dynamite.  You see a FUSE on the ground.  You also see a
chest. To the North is the ELEVATOR SHAFT. To the East is the MINE FACE. You
need a PICKAXE to go that way. To the South you see the LAMP ROOM.

>>> search CHEST

You search the chest. You found DYNAMITE and add it to your inventory.

>>> take FUSE

You grab the FUSE and add it to your inventory.

>>> go east

You try to go East, but you don't have PICKAXE so you die in a cave in. QQ
