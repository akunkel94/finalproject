You wake up in a pitch black room and with nothing in your pocket, the first thing you need to do is find a light source. Soon you find yourself in a large cavern. With darkness closing in and eerie noises, you must escape this cave maze before it's too late!

We are currently still working on the code so we haven't gotten a working make file. Update will come as soon as we have executable code for the game. Sorry about that. The project our group is doing is going to contain similar elements to the Python Adventure Game we worked on in class. It will contain similar elements but we're going to make it more of a maze. We've decided to use C++, and the maze will contain rooms and items that interact with each other. Our group is more comfortable using C++ so that's what we're doing.
