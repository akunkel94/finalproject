The project our group is doing is going to contain similar elements to the Python Adventure Game we worked on in class. It will contain 
similar elements but we're going to make it more of a maze. We're debating whether to use C++ or Python and the maze will contain rooms and
items that interact with each other. Python seems to be better for implementing the UNIX design philosophies learned in class for this kind 
of project so that's what we will most likely be working with.
