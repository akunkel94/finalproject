The project our group is doing is going to contain similar elements to the Python Adventure Game we worked on in class. It will contain 
similar elements but we're going to make it more of a maze. We've decided to use C++ and the maze will contain rooms and
items that interact with each other. Our group is more comfortable using C++ so that's what we're doing.
