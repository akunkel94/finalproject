The project our group is doing is going to be in the form of the Python Adventure Game program we did in class.
It is going to have similar elements, but we're going to make it a more of a maze. We're still not sure whether we want to use python or C++.
The maze is going to contain rooms and items and we will try to make an inventory for the user that will interact with other items or rooms in one way or another.
