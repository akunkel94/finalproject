You wake up in a dark cavern. You donâ€™t know how
you got here but it is up to you to figure out a way to get out. 
There are rooms around you with tools, keys etc. which you need to access
certain rooms. 
The commands at your exposal are:

	-go [NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST]
	-take [ITEM]
	-search [SEARCHABLE ITEM]
	-help

Remember, you can call the command 'help' at any
time to review the commands at your disposal.

Good Luck!
