You wake up in a dark cavern after getting kidnapped. You don’t exactly how
you got here but it is up to you to figure out a way to get out. 
There are rooms around you with tools, keys etc. around you to help you access
certain rooms. This game is called…. THE MAZE. 
You don’t know which room access what and there are different directions you
are allowed to go and your job is to find out which routes throughout the maze
accesses you to DAYLIGHT. 
GoodLuck!
